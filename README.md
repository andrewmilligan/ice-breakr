# Ice Breakr

Ice Breakr is a dumb little app built to help inject a little chaos into my
team's daily meetings. Coming up with a funny little ice breaker can be
stressful, so why not leave it to the gods of `Math.random()`?

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with
`create-t3-app`.
